# order(pre-release)

## A game compiled by Python with GUI made by only using tkinter.
----
## Existing issues:
* settings window is still unavailable because it is not finished
* This game is **still uncomplete** as its settings page is unfisihed, but that doesn't matter
* Almost **no comments** in these codes, but there would be enough comprehensive comments in the future

## Issues caused by `self.wm_overrideredirect(True)`:
* **cannot** maximize and minimize the window
* cannot be seen in Windows **mutitask view**
* it would be recogized as a **background process** when running

## Tips:
* Python 3.x (**3.7 recommended**)
* supported OS: **Windows**
* recommend **1080p** display resolution
* please set the **display scale 100%** in order to make the size displayed
* **'Century Gothic'** font family should be installed in order to ensure it can display properly
and you may download it from this **[link](https://www.cufonfonts.com/download/font/century-gothic)**
* **no** 3rd party packages required and make sure **tkinter** is installed
